# Encapusulation:- 
Binding of data(variables) and methods into single unit is known as Encapuslation.
Binding means to provide security. 
How do we provide security???
 We provide security by using access modifiers 
        1)public
        2)protected (_)
        3)private (__) 
Data Mangling :- To access the private Properites we use the concept of data mangling.
  # Syntax to access private Properites :-  object._className__MethodName 
class GrandFather():
    def __init__(self):
        self._a=10 
        self.__b = 20 
    def _fun1(self):
        print("This is our Farm")
    def __fun2(self):
        print("This is my Farmhouse") 
class Father(GrandFather):
    def fun3(self):
        print("I have 50cr")
