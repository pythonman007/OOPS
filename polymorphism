One into many forms is known as polymorphism. 
polymorphism is classified into two parts:
          1)Method Overloading.
          2)Method Overriding.
Method Overloading:- 
class MethodOverload():
    def fun1(self,a=None,b=None,c=None):
        print(a,b,c) 
ob = MethodOverload()  
ob.fun1(10,20,30)
ob.fun1(10,20) 
ob.fun1(10) 
ob.fun1() 
MethodOverride:- 
class MethodOverride():
    def fun1(self):
        print("hey python!!!") 
class Box(MethodOverride):
    def fun1(self):
        super().fun1()  
ob = Box() 
ob.fun1()
